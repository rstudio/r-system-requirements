# System Requirements for R Packages

[![CI Status](https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

R packages can depend on one another, but they can also depend on software
external to the R ecosystem. On Ubuntu 24.04, for example, in order to install
the `curl` R package, you must have previously run `apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev`. R
packages often note these dependencies in the `SystemRequirements` field within their `DESCRIPTION` files, but this
information is free-form text that varies by package.

This repository contains a catalog of "rules" that can be used to systematically
identify these dependencies and generate commands to install them.

You may be expecting to see a list like:

| Package | `SystemRequirements` | Dependency |
| ------  | ----------- | ----- |
| `curl`   | `libcurl: libcurl-devel (rpm) or libcurl4-openssl-dev (deb).` | `libcurl4-openssl-dev` |


Storing this information as a table in this format is not efficient. Many R
packages do not have any system dependencies, so the table would be very
sparse. Moreover, R packages are added at an exponential rate, so maintaining
this data would be nearly impossible.

Instead, this repository contains a set of rules that map a
`SystemRequirements` field to a platform specific install command such as
`apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev`.


## Usage

The primary purpose of this catalog is to support [Posit Package Manager](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/package-manager/),
which translates these rules into install commands for specific packages or
repositiories.

You can find the install commands for a package by viewing the package page in
[Posit Public Package Manager](https://p3m.dev/), or using the [`pak`](https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/sysreqs.html)
package in R. `pak` will also automatically install the system requirements when installing a package.

While Posit Package Manager is a professional product, this catalog is available as a community resource
under the MIT license. Please open an issue in this repository for any bugs or requests,
or see the [For Developers](#for-developers) section for how to contribute to this repository.

## Operating Systems

The rules in this catalog support the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04
- CentOS 7
- Rocky Linux 8[^1], 9
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9
- openSUSE 15.5, 15.6
- SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP5, 15 SP6

## For Developers

We welcome contributions to this catalog! To report a bug or request a rule,
please open an issue in this repository. To add or update a rule, fork this
repository and submit a pull request.

### Overview

Each system requirement rule is described by a JSON file in the [`rules/`](rules)
directory. The file is named <code><i>rule-name</i>.json</code>, where
*`rule-name`* is typically the name of the system dependency.

For example, here's an excerpt from a rule for the Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
library at [`rules/libprotobuf.json`](rules/libprotobuf.json).

```js
{
  "patterns": ["\\blibprotobuf\\b"],  // regex which matches "libprotobuf" or "LIBPROTOBUF; libxml2"
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "packages": ["protobuf-devel"],  // to install the package: "yum install protobuf-devel"
      "pre_install": [
        {
          "command": "yum install -y epel-release"  // add the EPEL repository before installing
        }
      ],
      "constraints": [
        {
          "os": "linux",
          "distribution": "centos",  // make these instructions specific to CentOS 7
          "versions": ["7"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Other examples:
- Simple rule: [`git.json`](rules/git.json)
- OS version constraints (package names vary by OS version): [`libmysqlclient.json`](rules/libmysqlclient.json)
- Pre-install steps (adding the EPEL repo on CentOS/RHEL): [`gdal.json`](rules/gdal.json)
- Post-install steps (reconfiguring R for Java): [`java.json`](rules/java.json)

### JSON Fields

```js
{
  "patterns": [...],
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "packages": [...],
      "constraints": [
        {
          "os": ...,
          "distribution": ...,
          "versions": [...]
        }
      ],
      "pre_install": [
        {
          "command": ...,
          "script": ...
        }
      ],
      "post_install": [
        {
          "command": ...,
          "script": ...
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `patterns` | Array | Regular expressions to match `SystemRequirements` fields. Case-insensitive. Note that the escape character must be escaped itself (`\\.` to match a dot). Use word boundaries (`\\b`) for more accurate matches.<br/>Example: `["\\bgnu make\\b", "\\bgmake\\b"]` to match `GNU Make` or `gmake; OpenSSL` |
| `dependencies` | Array | Rules for installing the dependency on one or more operating systems. See [dependencies](#dependencies). |

#### Dependencies

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `packages` | Array | Packages installed through the default system package manager (e.g. apt, yum, zypper). Examples: `["libxml2-dev"]`, `["tcl", "tk"]` |
| `constraints` | Array | One or more operating system constraints. See [constraints](#constraints). |
| `pre_install` | Array | Optional commands or scripts to run before installing packages (e.g. adding a third-party repository). See [pre/post-install actions](#prepost-install-actions).
| `post_install` | Array | Optional commands or scripts to run after installing packages (e.g. cleaning up). See [pre/post-install actions](#prepost-install-actions).

#### Constraints

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `os` | String | Operating system. Only `"linux"` is supported for now. |
| `distribution` | String | Linux distribution. One of `"ubuntu"`, `"debian"`, `"centos"`, `"redhat"`, `"opensuse"`, `"sle"`, `"fedora"` |
| `versions` | Array | Optional set of OS versions. If unspecified, the rule applies to all supported versions. See [`systems.json`](systems.json) for supported values by OS. Example: `["24.04"]` for Ubuntu. |

#### Pre/post-install actions

Pre-install and post-install actions can be specified as either a `command` or
`script`. Commands are preferred unless there's complicated logic involved.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `command` | String | A shell command. Example: `"dnf install -y epel-release"` |
| `script` | String | A shell script found in the [`scripts`](scripts) directory. Example: `"centos_epel.sh"` |

### Adding a rule

A typical workflow for adding a new rule consists of:

1. Come up with regular expressions to match all R packages with the system
   dependency. See [`sysreqs.json`](test/sysreqs.json) for a sample list of
   CRAN packages and their `SystemRequirements` fields.
   Note that the applicable R packages don't have to be on CRAN; they can be on
   GitHub or other repositories, such as Bioconductor and rOpenSci.
2. Determine the system packages and any pre/post-install steps if needed.
   The more operating systems covered, the better, but it's fine if only some
   operating systems are covered.

   Useful resources for finding packages across different OSs:
   - https://pkgs.org
   - https://repology.org

   Or to search for packages on each OS:
   ```sh
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   apt-cache search <package-name>

   # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
   yum search <package-name>

   # openSUSE/SLE
   zypper search <package-name>
   ```
3. Add the new rule as a <code><i>rule-name</i>.json</code> file in the `rules` directory.
4. Run the schema tests and (optionally) the system package tests locally.
5. Submit a pull request.

### Testing

#### Schema tests

To lint and validate rules against the schema, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the tests
npm test
```

To list R packages and system requirements matched by a rule:

```sh
# List matching system requirements for a rule
npm run test-patterns -- rules/libcurl.json --verbose

# List matching system requirements for all rules
npm run test-patterns-all -- --verbose

# Fail if a rule doesn't match any system requirements
npm run test-patterns-all -- --strict
```

To update the list of R packages and system requirements used for testing, run:

```sh
make update-sysreqs
```

#### System package tests

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images are provided to help validate system
packages on supported OSs.

Available tags:
- `focal` (Ubuntu 20.04)
- `jammy` (Ubuntu 22.04)
- `noble` (Ubuntu 24.04)
- `buster` (Debian 10)
- `bullseye` (Debian 11)
- `bookworm` (Debian 12)
- `sid` (Debian unstable)
- `centos7` (CentOS 7)
- `centos8` (Rocky Linux 8)
- `rockylinux9` (Rocky Linux 9)
- `opensuse155` (openSUSE 15.5)
- `fedora36` (Fedora 36)
- `fedora37` (Fedora 37)
- `fedora38` (Fedora 38)
- `fedora39` (Fedora 39)

To build the images:

```sh
# Build a specific image (e.g. focal)
make build-focal

# Build all images
make build-all
```

To test the rules:

```sh
# Test a specific rule on an OS (e.g. focal)
make test-focal RULES=rules/libcurl.json

# Test a specific rule on all OSs
make test-all RULES=rules/libcurl.json

# Test all rules on all OSs
make test-all
```

### Schema

The JSON schema is defined in the file [`schema.json`](schema.json). Do not
modify this file directly, since it is automatically generated. Instead, modify
`schema.template.json` and then run `npm run generate-schema`. The
`generate-schema` target is automatically run when running `npm test`.

If you need to modify the distros and/or versions supported in the schema definitions,
modify [`systems.json`](systems.json).
